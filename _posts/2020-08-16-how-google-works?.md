Ever wondered how Google Search (Or any other Search Engine) works? Here you can read about How a Search Engine works.

Imagine that you are on a library in which almost every books are available. You are there and asks the librarian for the 'Harry Potter' book.

Then the librarian goes to the shelf and returns back with all of the seven books in Harry Potter series. And, you selects the second one, The Chamber of Secrets and leaves the Library.


That's it. This is how Google works too. They have a large collection of data from almost every sites in the world. Whenever a user searches with a query, the system will search for the keywords matching with the query over their largest "Library". And filter the data based on the query. Then they return the query results to the user in a well cleaned form of "Search results". They use advanced machine learning algorithms to clean up the data so that the user won't be confused and the user gets the exact result what he really wants. Let's take a look from the beginning. Like, how they collect the data.

Google and every other search engines use tools called crawlers to extract data from each website. Crawlers are also known as web spiders, since they behave like spiders in most of the cases. By starting to crawl from the home page, they advance to all other pages. The way the spider build their webs. From one branch to another and to next.

They store the crawled data to their databases, and then cleans it. Then they return search results based on user queries. This is the most important part. Because, users won't like to scroll and navigate to each and every pages looking for what they want. They need everything in just a few clicks. And, Google knows it and they are far better than the competitors for delivering results what the user is looking for.

That's all fo now. Hope you got an idea on how search engine works.
